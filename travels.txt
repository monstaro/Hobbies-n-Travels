My parents took me to NYC a bunch as a kid (I lived about 6 hours away) and I remember instantly falling
in love with the energy of the city. Of course, living in one now, I often miss the simple country lifestyle,
but I do love the energy of the city and I attribute where I am now to those trips when I was younger.
